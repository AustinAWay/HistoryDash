# Claude Instructions - Coaching Coach

## Timezone Handling (CRITICAL)

**User location:** London, UK
**Schedule data timezone:** Central Time (Austin, TX)

### DST Transitions Are Different
- **US Central:** Springs forward 2nd Sunday of March, falls back 1st Sunday of November
- **UK:** Springs forward last Sunday of March, falls back last Sunday of October

### Current Offset Calculation
DO NOT assume a fixed offset. Calculate based on the actual date:

| Period | US Central | UK | Offset (London ahead) |
|--------|------------|-----|----------------------|
| Early March (before US DST) | CST (UTC-6) | GMT (UTC+0) | 6 hours |
| Mid-March to late March (US changed, UK hasn't) | CDT (UTC-5) | GMT (UTC+0) | **5 hours** |
| Late March to late October (both on summer time) | CDT (UTC-5) | BST (UTC+1) | 6 hours |
| Late Oct to early Nov (UK changed, US hasn't) | CDT (UTC-5) | GMT (UTC+0) | 5 hours |
| November to early March (both on winter time) | CST (UTC-6) | GMT (UTC+0) | 6 hours |

### 2026 Key Dates
- **March 8, 2026:** US springs forward (CST → CDT)
- **March 29, 2026:** UK springs forward (GMT → BST)
- **October 25, 2026:** UK falls back (BST → GMT)
- **November 1, 2026:** US falls back (CDT → CST)

### When User Gives London Time
1. Check current date
2. Determine if US and UK are in sync or offset
3. Convert to Central time before updating `SCHEDULE` in dashboard
4. Run `python sync_schedule.py` after schedule changes

## Project Structure

- **Schedule source of truth:** `SCHEDULE` list in `coaching_dashboard.py`
- **Sync to markdown:** `python sync_schedule.py`
- **Coaching Dashboard:** Flask app on `localhost:5000` - schedule, messaging, call prep
- **AP Social Studies Dashboard:** Flask app on `localhost:5001` - Timeback/Austin Way progress tracking
  - Source: `ap_socsci_dashboard.py`
  - Data: pulls from Timeback learning data + Austin Way mastery + registration spreadsheet
  - Features: XP tracking, unit completion, recommendations (MCQ/FRQ/Stay/PT)
- **Student data:** `student_plans_v3/` (gitignored, private)

## Document Versions (IMPORTANT)

**Always use the latest version.** The V3 data lives in the folder structure:

| Data | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Individual student plans** | `student_plans_v3/*.md` | THIS IS V3 - always use this |
| **Student questions** | `student_plans_v3/questions/` | Weekly question sets |
| **Master schedule** | `student_plans_v3/MASTER_COACHING_SCHEDULE.md` | Auto-generated from dashboard |
| Historical reference | `COACHING_PLAN.md`, `PERSONALIZED_LEARNING_PLANS*.md` | V2.0 - for background only |

**When briefing on a student:** Read from `student_plans_v3/StudentName.md` first, not the root-level planning docs.

## Sending Messages

Via dashboard API:
- Questions: `http://localhost:5000/send-question/Student%20Name/week`
- Smart send (tries Slack, falls back to email): `http://localhost:5000/send/Student%20Name/week`

## Running Dashboards

```bash
# Coaching dashboard (port 5000)
python coaching_dashboard.py

# AP Social Studies dashboard (port 5001)
python ap_socsci_dashboard.py
```

## Git Workflow

- Student-specific files are gitignored
- Framework code (scripts, templates) is committed
- After editing `SCHEDULE`, run sync script before committing
